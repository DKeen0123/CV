I'm a business graduate with operations and analytics experience in two exciting tech startups, tired of being on the client-facing surface of business and wanting to take a deep-dive into the creation and production of the technology itself.

## Skills

##### Analysis

Looking at trends, trying to decipher some sort of meaning from them and then acting on it has always been one of my strong points.

As an SEO intern at Wirex, I focused my energy on seeing what top competitors were doing, but most importantly, what competitors **weren't** doing, and then giving our content creators the tools and the knowledge to exploit this. This led to a sharp uptick in organic visitors to the site, and content that I refactored according to my findings saw a great boost to their rankings in google.

##### Communication

##### Strategy and Planning
